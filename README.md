This is a template for any [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) app using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo to your machine:

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:imoaazahmed/nextjs-template.git
```

Secend, run the development server:

```bash
    yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying  `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)  can be accessed on  [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in  `pages/api/hello.js`.

The  `pages/api`  directory is mapped to  `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as  [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)  instead of React pages.

## Pages

You can create a new page by following the same way in Next.js to create a new page.
Check the Next.js documentations about createing new pages. [Click here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)
